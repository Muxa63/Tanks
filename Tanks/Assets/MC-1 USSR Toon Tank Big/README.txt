Thanks for buy this asset.

There are 3 scenes:
1) Overview;
2) SimpleControl with simple script of control tank, im not good at scripts now, so there are only tank move, wheels move, and tracks texture offset;
3) Studio scene.

Model have Armatures for animations and tracks are different objects to controll texture.

All textures in 2k, downscale like you want.

Also you can check my USSR Tanks pack here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/land/ussr-toon-light-tanks-105342

Enjoy and please leave a review and comment at asset page;)
